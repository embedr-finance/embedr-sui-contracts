Here is a template for the struct comments. Always use this format when documenting structs.

```move
/// <ONE LINE STRUCT DESCRIPTION HERE>
/// 
/// 
/// # Fields
/// 
/// * `field1` - <SMALL DESCRIPTION OF THE FIELD>
/// * `field2` - <SMALL DESCRIPTION OF THE FIELD>
/// * `field3` - <SMALL DESCRIPTION OF THE FIELD>
struct <STRUCT NAME> has <CAPABILITIES> {
    field1: Type1,
    field2: Type2,
    field3: Type3,
}
```
