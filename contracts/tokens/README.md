# Tokens Package

## Overview

The Tokens Package is a collection of smart contracts that manage various aspects of tokens such as rUSD and EMBD and their utilities. It provides a robust and secure framework for users to interact with these tokens within the protocol.

## Available Contracts

The following contracts are included in the package:

- [EMBD Incentive Token](https://github.com/embedr-finance/embedr-sui-contracts/blob/prototype/contracts/tokens/sources/embd_incentive_token.move)

- [rUSD Stable Coin](https://github.com/embedr-finance/embedr-sui-contracts/blob/prototype/contracts/tokens/sources/rusd_stable_coin.move)

Each contract has its own documentation written as comments in the source code.
